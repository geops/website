## Exactly for everything

Finding the exact way from A to B is no problem today - as long as you are traveling by car or on foot. It looks different if you need the route of a bus or train. We support a large number of vehicles with our routing service. We deliver better results than any other service, especially when it comes to public transport vehicles. We can offer this quality because the routing is based on richly attributed data from the rail, road and footpath network and uses sophisticated heuristics.

## Suitable

The routing is adapted to our maps. For long distances that are used in small-scale overviews, the routes are simplified ("generalized") in exactly the same way as in the maps, so that they fit exactly on the map background. For detailed views, on the other hand, the routes can be calculated in great detail, right down to individual tracks in the station.

One application of routing can be found in our worldwide tracker, in which the routes are calculated as trajectories for all vehicles.

Routing is used for numerous projects. For example, the routes are shown in our \[real-time tracker] (https://maps2.trafimage.ch/ch.sbb.netzkarte?baselayers=ch.sbb.netzkarte,ch.sbb.netzkarte.dark,ch.sbb.netzkarte .luftbild.group, ch.sbb.netzkarte.landeskarte, ch.sbb.netzkarte.landeskarte.grau & lang = de & layers = ch.sbb.puenktlichkeit-all & x = 925472 & y = 5920000 & z = 9) calculated above. The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) uses the routing for trains, trams, buses and cable cars to provide travelers with detailed information on the course of the travel route. Routing is also available in [mapset](https://mapset.io/) to simplify the drawing of footpaths in the map.

## Where along and how

Exact routes also have the potential to analyze the characteristics along the route. On this basis, we offer, for example, exact height profiles or counts of objects such as level crossings, traffic lights or pedestrian crossings along the route. Here we offer evaluations specifically tailored to your requirements.
