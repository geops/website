Our developer portal offers a toolbox for applications in public transport and mobility in general. The tools include open source libraries as well as programming interfaces (API), which are inspired by the experience of many projects for transport companies.

The tools support extensive and precise information for passengers based on timetables as well as deviations and disruptions, much of it in real time. An important focus is on spatial information that is specially optimized for the needs of public transport. The results are APIs for maps that particularly highlight features of public transport, or APIs that visualize the exact course of one of the routes of trains or buses or track the real-time positions of vehicles.
