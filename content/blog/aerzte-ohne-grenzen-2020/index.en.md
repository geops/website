We have been supporting Médecins Sans Frontières for several years. In 2020, we were once again able to support the association's dedicated humanitarian workers in their great work as a partner company. The association provides emergency medical aid in crisis and war zones around the globe. The international organization helps quickly, efficiently and unbureaucratically - without asking about the origin, religion or political convictions of the people affected. The doctors and nurses, midwives and logisticians of Médecins Sans Frontières work in around 70 countries. They treat sick and wounded people, care for malnourished children and provide clean drinking water and latrines.
