After a break due to corona, the [IT-TRANS](https://www.it-trans.org/) will take place again this year, from 10 to 12 May at the trade fair in Karlsruhe. We will be exhibiting at the leading international conference and trade fair for intelligent solutions in public transport and presenting our solutions for digital passenger information.

Visit us in the dm-Arena at stand 6. We are looking forward to a personal exchange. Please write to us if we can provide you with a free admission ticket from our contingent.
