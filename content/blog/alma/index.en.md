***alma* – our brand-new next-generation solution for managing contaminated sites**

Building on years of experience with legacy software, we’ve completely redeveloped alma: modern, efficient, and more intuitive than ever. Authorities now have a web-based platform that unites data, geospatial tools, workflows, and reports in one place ,developed collaboratively as an open-source project with federal and cantonal partners.

## Centralized Data Management and Geospatial Editing

*alma* enables complete recording of all relevant site data: basic information, protection areas, environmental data, and historical records. Thanks tointegrated geospatial editing, sites can be digitized, geometries edited, and visualized on maps – no external GIS software required. Tools like snapping, tracing, moving, and import/export of geodata ensure precise work and automated quality control.

## Efficient Business Processes and Task Management

The software provides a flexible business control system to structure tasks and workflows. Deadlines, responsibilities, document links, and automated letters can be managed seamlessly. Complex processes such as site assessment, remediation, or owner notifications can be automated and linked to site data.

## Reports and Interfaces

*alma* generates reports and data sheets directly from the database in common formats. Interfaces allow automated data export, integration with GIS systems, or provision in legally required formats like INTERLIS (MGDM, ÖREB). Seamless connection to the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) or public geoportals is fully supported.

## Security and User Management

*alma* meets the highest IT security and data protection standards. User accounts and permissions are easily managed, and SSO integration is possible. Automated security scans and optional audits ensure a secure environment.

## Community-Driven and Open Source

*alma* is **jointly developed by cantons, federal authorities, and the Principality of Liechtenstein**. As an Open-Source project, it ensures transparency, reduces vendor dependence, and promotes digital sovereignty and sustainability. New partners are always welcome, and development follows shared priorities.

**Conclusion:** *alma* is not just a tool for managing contaminated sites – it is an **efficient, secure, and future-ready solution** that helps authorities meet legal requirements.
