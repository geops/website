Managing contaminated sites is complex and requires precise, traceable data. *alma* offers authorities a modern, web-based solution covering the entire lifecycle of a site – from data collection and assessment to publication in the public register (KbS).

## Centralized Data Management and Geospatial Editing

alma enables complete recording of all relevant site data: basic information, protection areas, environmental data, and historical records. Thanks to **integrated geospatial editing**, sites can be digitized, geometries edited, and visualized on maps – no external GIS software required. Tools like snapping, tracing, moving, and import/export of Shapefiles, KML, or GeoPackage ensure precise work and automated quality control.

## Efficient Business Processes & Task Management

The software provides a **flexible business control** system to structure tasks and workflows. Deadlines, responsibilities, document links, and automated letters can be managed seamlessly. Complex processes such as site assessment, remediation, or owner notifications can be automated and linked to site data.

## Reports & Interfaces

alma generates **reports, data sheets, and bulk letters** directly from the database in common formats (Word, Excel, PDF). Interfaces allow automated data export, integration with GIS systems, or provision in legally required formats like INTERLIS (MGDM, ÖREB). Integration with BAFU or public geoportals is fully supported.

## Security & User Management

alma meets the highest **IT security and data protection standards**. User accounts and permissions are easily managed, and SSO integration is possible. Automated security scans and optional audits ensure a secure environment.

## Community-Driven & Open Source

alma is **jointly developed by cantons, federal authorities, and the Principality of Liechtenstein**. As an Open-Source project, it ensures transparency, reduces vendor dependence, and promotes digital sovereignty and sustainability. New partners are always welcome, and development follows shared priorities.

**Conclusion:** alma is not just a tool for managing contaminated sites – it is an **efficient, secure, and future-ready solution** that helps authorities meet legal requirements while saving costs.
