Our annual company excursion took place at the end of June - and this time it was time for the geOps team to go from the model signal box to wine tasting.

### Day 1: Technology & teamwork in the railroad operations laboratory

We started early at the **Swiss Railway Operations Laboratory** in Dübendorf. There we were able to experience live how timetables not only work in theory, but are actually implemented in a detailed model operation: Trains in miniature format, signal box action and precise cycle time control. For us at geOps - developers of digital solutions for public transport - it felt like a playful continuation of our daily work, only with real levers and tracks.

### Day 2: Culture, views & wine

The second day continued in a relaxed manner: a visit to **Munot Fortress** in Schaffhausen, a hike to **Siblingerhöhe** and finally a leisurely walk to a winery in Hallau. There we ended the day with a fine wine tasting and culinary snacks - in the best weather and in a relaxed atmosphere.

### F﻿indings & conclusions

The trip not only gave us exciting insights into the world of timetabling and railroad technology, but also showed us how important good timing and clear communication are - whether in model operation or in everyday project work at geOps. Away from the screen, there was room for exchange, shared experiences and real team cohesion.

And incidentally, we also discovered that when planning, collaboration and the right timing are right, things run almost as reliably as Swiss rail traffic.
