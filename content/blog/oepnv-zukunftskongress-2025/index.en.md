As a developer of **innovative software solutions for local public transport (LPT)**, we will be presenting our latest technologies and products that contribute to seamless and efficient mobility.

### Multimodal mobility card for the RVF

Regional and innovative - a special highlight is the presentation of our multimodal mobility map for the Freiburg Regional Transport Association (RVF). This provides a real-time overview of all forms and aspects of mobility - directly on site in Freiburg, where the congress is taking place. The local relevance makes this solution particularly exciting and shows what modern mobility can look like in urban and rural areas.

### NVBW connection assurance: improving the quality of local rail passenger transport

Another focal point is the "Connection assurance" project of the Baden-Württemberg public transport company (NVBW). This aims to increase the punctuality and reliability of connections - a central component of the **Action Plan for Quality in Local Rail Passenger Transport** and the **Local Public Transport Strategy 2030 of the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Transport**. We show how our software solutions help to sustainably improve the quality and thus the acceptance of public transport.

### Innovative software solutions from geOps

In addition to these specific projects, we present our broad portfolio of software solutions that are tailored to the needs of modern mobility:

**Live maps and real-time forecasts:** Precise display of vehicle positions on interactive maps with real-time data.

**Routing and network plans:** Optimized routing for different means of transport and automated network plans based on current timetable data.

**moco:** Information in the event of incidents  the tool for incident and construction site communication.

**Mapset:** Do-it-yourself plans  easy creation of individual plans for public transport.

**TRALIS:** Hub for timetable and real-time data  Integration and processing of timetable data to enable reliable forecasts and comprehensive data analysis.

**MobilityCMS:** The website construction kit specially developed for public transport companies to provide information efficiently and in a targeted manner.
