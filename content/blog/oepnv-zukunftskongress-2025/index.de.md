As a developer of **innovative software solutions for local public transport (LPT)**, we will be presenting our latest technologies and products that contribute to seamless and efficient mobility.

### Multimodal mobility card for the RVF

Regional and innovative - a special highlight is the presentation of our multimodal mobility card for the Freiburg Regional Transport Association (RVF). This provides a real-time overview of all forms and aspects of mobility - directly on site in Freiburg, where the congress is taking place. The local relevance makes this solution particularly exciting and shows what modern mobility can look like in urban and rural areas.

### Ensuring connections with the NVBW: improving the quality of local rail passenger transport

Another focal point is the "Anschlusssicherung" project of the Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg (NVBW). This aims to increase the punctuality and reliability of connections - a central component of the **Action Plan for Quality in Local Rail Passenger Transport** and the **Local Public Transport Strategy 2030 of the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Transport**. We show how our software solutions help to sustainably improve the quality and thus the acceptance of public transport.

### Innovative software solutions from geOps

In addition to these specific projects, we present our broad portfolio of software solutions that are tailored to the needs of modern mobility:

**Live maps and real-time forecasts:** Precise display of vehicle positions on interactive maps with real-time data.

**Routing and route network plans:** Optimized routing for different modes of transport and automated network plans based on current timetable data.

**moco:** Information in the event of incidents: the tool for incident and construction site communication.

**Mapset:** Do-it-yourself maps: easy creation of individual maps for public transport.

**TRALIS:** Hub for timetable and real-time data: Integration and processing of timetable data to enable reliable forecasts and comprehensive data analysis.

**mobilityCMS:** The website construction kit specially developed for public transport companies to provide information in an efficient and targeted manner.
