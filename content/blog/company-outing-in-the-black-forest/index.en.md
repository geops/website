After a busy first half of the year, it was finally time for some relaxation and a cozy get-together away from the daily grind. This time, our annual two-day company outing took us to the southern Black Forest, where we were able to escape the hot weather and enjoy nature.

Our adventure began with the train ride to Schluchsee. We had originally planned a trip on the historic Sauschw채nzlebahn, but due to a locomotive fault we had to change our plans. Instead, an idyllic boat trip on the Schluchsee awaited us. We glided across the water in bright sunshine and admired the surrounding landscape. The cool, fresh air and picturesque scenery immediately put us in a good mood and helped us relax.

## Guided tour of the Baden State Brewery Rothaus

After the boat trip, we made our way to the Badische Staatsbrauerei Rothaus brewery. A hearty lunch of Z채pflesuppe soup and roast beer awaited us there. Invigorated and in a good mood, we then took part in a brewery tour, during which we also learned that we had previously only drunk "the purest medicine" (as the brewery guide put it). The tour offered exciting insights into the art of brewing and the history of Rothaus.

We ended the day with a relaxed dinner in a hotel in Waldshut. Over delicious cocktails and in convivial company, we reflected on the day's experiences and looked forward to the next day's excursion. Of course, a little "medicine" was not to be missed.

## Visit to the cavern power plant in Bad S채ckingen

The next morning, another highlight was on the agenda: a visit to the Bad S채ckingen cavern power plant, the first of its kind in Germany. The journey through the access tunnel, which took us 1.5 kilometers deep into the mountain, was an adventure in itself. In the cavern, which was impressive at 160 meters long, 23 meters wide and 33 meters high, we were able to marvel at the four large turbines. The tour offered interesting insights into the technology and operation of the power plant.
