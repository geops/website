**We are happy to announce the start of Amelie Kerkloh (Office Manager), Vanessa Behre (Communication Designer) and Rouying Li (Backend Developer).**

Amelie supports the management with administrative tasks and HR management. Previously, she worked in various industries such as the hotel industry, marketing and retail.

Vanessa has over 10 years of agency experience, including as an art director. After an excursion to the far north, she came back to sunny Freiburg and is responsible for concept, design and marketing as a communication designer.Â 

Ruoying is studying computer science in Konstanz with a focus on algorithms and is working with us as part of a six-month internship. Be curious which cool product we will soon present as a result of her internship.
