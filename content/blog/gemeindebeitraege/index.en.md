Thanks to automation, open data and intelligent logic, a previously complex process is now handled quickly, reliably and transparently.

## The starting point: high costs for fair cost distribution

Public transport in the canton of Lucerne is co-financed by the participating municipalities. To ensure that costs are distributed fairly, the VVL calculates the [municipal contributions](https://www.vvl.ch/oev-angebot/dienstleistungen/finanzierung/gemeindebeitraege) annually. This is based on the number of departures at all stops in a municipality – a clear method in itself, but one that was costly to implement in practice.  

Until now, the timetable data was evaluated by the transport companies, manually transferred to a template, sent to the VVL and checked there on a random basis. This process was very time-consuming for the transport companies and the VVL and was also prone to errors. The VVL therefore sought a solution to automate the process while increasing the quality and traceability of the results.

## The solution: automation with open GTFS data

Our customised solution is based on the open timetable data (GTFS) from [opentransportdata.swiss](https://opentransportdata.swiss). It automatically determines the number of departures per stop and municipality, taking into account all relevant special cases:

* **S﻿easons and public holidays** with different timetables
* **L﻿oops** where journeys must not be counted twice
* **N﻿on-contributory lines or categories**, which are filtered out
* **T﻿emporary restrictions**, e.g. due to construction sites, which are ignored

The calculation is transparent and traceable at all times. Anomalies and inconsistencies are automatically detected, ensuring a quality-assured result.

## The benefits: faster processing, fewer errors, satisfied partners

What used to take many hours of manual work is now largely automated. Fast, reliable and transparent.

* Significantly less effort for evaluations and follow-up works
* L﻿ess effort for administrative processes
* E﻿rror reduction through automated calculations and integrated quality assurance
* Clearly traceable results for municipalities and transport companies
* Flexible adaptability for future lines, stops or regulations

> *Manually processing around 140 Excel files is now a thing of the past. Thanks to geOps' automated timetable evaluation, we save time, reduce errors and gain noticeable efficiency – not only for us, but also for the transport companies.*

*— Sylvie Gernet, Public Transport Finance Specialist at VVL*

Thanks to our experience and the use of standardised data formats, the project was completed with minimal effort – to the customer's complete satisfaction.

## Achieving more together
