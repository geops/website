In the course of launching a new marketing strategy for their railway stations SBB decided to make access to information more comfortable and more attractive. The result is a beautiful map that can be seen in action on [central pages](http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services.html) of the SBB website.

Stations can be found by means of a full text search or by navigating the map. The map supports four languages and integrates seamlessly with the SBB site. It runs on desktop browsers as well as on tablets.

The map is part of the [Trafimage](http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/am-bahnhof/railway-stations/trafimage-maps-station-plans.html) map series of SBB. We are happy about the successful project and thank SBB for the order.
