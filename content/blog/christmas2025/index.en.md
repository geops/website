Last Friday, we deliberately brought the year to a close at geOps. Before the calendar finally quietened down, we took some time in the office for a short workshop and our annual review. What were the challenges? What were the highlights? What are we looking forward to next year?

Afterwards, we continued on to [Esswerkstatt](https://rausch-familienwerkstatt.de/esswerkstatt/) with mulled wine. There, we cooked a delicious three-course meal together, chopped, laughed, and finally ate together. No big fuss, just the kind of evening that reminds us why collaboration is more than just deadlines and to-do lists.

Moments like these sharpen our focus: stability is valuable. Safety and health cannot be taken for granted. This becomes particularly apparent when sitting together at the table.

That's why taking responsibility is also part of our agenda this year. Quietly, consistently, and with conviction. We have once again supported **[Médecins Sans Frontières](https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.de/)** with a donation. Without fanfare, but with a clear stance.

As the year draws to a close, we would like to say thank you above all: to our customers for their trust, the exciting projects, and the open exchange. And to everyone who has accompanied us this year.

We wish you peaceful holidays, good food, good conversations. And the ability to see beyond your own horizons.
