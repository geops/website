Climate protection and sustainability are a central goal in our work ([Blog post: Ecological sustainability at geOps](/en/blog/sustainability)). On 19 October, we received the [MobilSiegel](https://www.vag-freiburg.de/service-infos/mobilitaet-fuer-unternehmen/mobilsiegel) award for sustainable corporate mobility.

A total of 28 companies were awarded for their commitment by the Freiburger Verkehrs AG (VAG) on behalf of the city of Freiburg and in cooperation with the districts of Emmmendingen and Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald.

At the award ceremony, the monthly internet and electricity allowance for work at home, our public transport extras (railcard, job ticket, mobility budget, ...), support for commuting by bike and the additional days of holiday when foregoing private air travel ([Blog post: Fly or drive?](/en/blog/driveorfly)) were highlighted as 'best practice' in our company . We are proud to have reached the highest level with 5 leaves and see the award as an incentive to continue to strengthen our company in terms of sustainable mobility.
