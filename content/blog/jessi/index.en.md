## **A look behind the scenes at geOps**

Our strengths are not just data, maps and mobility solutions - but above all the people behind them. In our new series of interviews, we introduce you to colleagues from the geOps team.

Let's start with: **Jessi - Software Engineer at geOps**

**What brought you to the company?**\
I joined the company as a trainee and absolute career changer. I was particularly attracted by the focus on public transport, mobility and the environment - areas that are extremely important to me.

**What have you learned here that you never learned on a course or at university?**\
I've learned that it's not just okay, but important, to ask questions and ask for help. Especially in everyday working life, you learn the most by exchanging ideas with colleagues. Only those who ask questions really understand the context and continue to develop.

**What are you currently working on?**\
I currently work in the IT infrastructure team and deal with day-to-day support requests from the team and look after our server infrastructure, but I also help with the implementation of smaller features in our software products. For example, I am currently working on report generation as part of the new development of our legacy management system. This allows me to gain technical insights as well as make a practical contribution to the further development of our solutions.
