      title: Complex requirements for the KbS
      text: The Federal Act on Environmental Protection requires Swiss cantons and
        federal agencies to create a publicly accessible register of
        contaminated sites (KbS). geOps has been developing software for the
        creation and management of the KbS in Switzerland for over 20 years.
        Since 2011, Altlast4Web has been the standard for managing the KbS.
        Since 2025, alma has been the modern software solution that supports all
        tasks in this area.

      title: More than just site management
      text: alma combines data management, geodata processing, and process control in
        one system. Site perimeters can be digitized and mapped directly. At the
        same time, alma supports individual business processes from assessment
        to remediation and links them closely to the site data. Automated
        reports, interfaces to geoportals and ÖREB, and high security standards
        round off the solution.

      title: Jointly developed, openly accessible
      text: alma is open source and was jointly financed and developed by around 20
        cantons, federal offices, and the Principality of Liechtenstein. This
        reduces costs, creates synergies, and ensures sustainable further
        development. For administrations, this means digital sovereignty and
        long-term investment security.
