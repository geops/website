      title: Create an overview, awaken the travel bug
      text: >-
        Direct rail connections from Switzerland to Europe are becoming
        increasingly popular. Our client SBB is well aware of this. The aim of
        the project was to present all these day and night connections in a
        clearly structured, easy-to-use map.


        Some routes offer both day and night connections. To show these in parallel, we created a route network map. This allows interested parties to see at a glance whether there are day and/or night connections on a particular route.


        In addition, users can call up a complete list of the corresponding connections when selecting a line or station. A fold-out string of pearls also shows all intermediate stops, making it an ideal source of inspiration for new travel ideas directly from the nearest major station.


        Given the growing importance of night connections, there is also a [separate map](https://www.sbb.ch/de/freizeit-ferien/europa/nachtzug.html) with our Darkstyle base map in the background.

        The heart of the solution is our geoCMS **Cartaro**. Here, SBB can
        independently maintain all connections that are to be displayed on the
        map. Europe-wide train networks are available for this purpose, on which
        any connections can be freely entered. In keeping with the spirit of an
        international map, this works in four languages (German, French, Italian
        and English).


        In addition to distinguishing between day and night connections, stops, brief descriptions and links can also be added.


        A specially developed algorithm automatically generates the route network plan based on this data. Even during processing, SBB can check the plan in a preview before creating the current vector tiles at the touch of a button.

      title: "Looking ahead: even more service for rail passengers"
      text: >-
        International rail travel will continue to grow in importance, and the
        ‘Direct connections to Europe’ map will evolve accordingly. We are
        already working on ideas to give rail passengers even more support with
        their travel planning.


        The map is integrated into the SBB website under [Direct connections](https://www.sbb.ch/de/freizeit-ferien/destinationen/staedte-laender-europa.html) and \[Night connections to Europe](https://www.sbb.ch/de/ leisure-holidays/trains-excursions/night-train.html) and, like most of our maps, is also available on the \[Trafimage web map portal](https://maps.trafimage.ch/ch.sbb.direktverbindungen?baselayers=ch.sbb.direktverbindungen. base-light,ch.sbb.direktverbindungen.base-dark,ch.sbb.direktverbindungen.base-aerial&lang=en&layers=ch.sbb.direktverbindungen.night,ch.sbb.direktverbindungen.day&x=925472&y=5920000&z=9).

  lead: A city break in Venice or an important business meeting in Berlin? Many
    European destinations can be reached comfortably and environmentally
    friendly by train from Switzerland. There are direct day and night
    connections to numerous cities from various Swiss railway stations. Our map
    [‘Direct connections to
    Europe’](https://www.sbb.ch/de/freizeit-ferien/destinationen/staedte-laender-europa.html)
    for SBB shows this in a visually appealing way with a route network map.
