title: "Direct connections to Europe: an interactive route map "
summary: A city break in Venice or an important business meeting in Berlin?
  There are direct day and night connections to major European cities from
  various Swiss railway stations. The trend towards more environmentally
  conscious travel and choosing the train even for longer distances prompted SBB
  to create an overview map of direct train connections to European
  destinations. With our route map "Direct connections to Europe", SBB now shows
  its customers all important international connections at a glance on its
  website.

      title: Creating clarity – visually appealing, structured and informative
      text: >-
        Direct rail connections from Switzerland to Europe are becoming
        increasingly popular. Our client SBB is well aware of this. The aim of
        the project was to display day and night connections on a clearly
        structured, easy-to-use web map. Some routes offer both day and night
        connections. To enable travellers to see at a glance whether a day or
        night train, or even both, is available for their destination, we
        created an easy-to-understand and attractively designed route map. 


        When selecting a line or station, users can call up a complete list of the corresponding connections. A drop-down pearl chain also shows all intermediate stops, making it an ideal source of inspiration for new travel ideas directly from the nearest major station.


        For the growing importance of night connections, there is also a separate map with our Darkstyle base map in the background.

      title: "Flexible, precise and automated: user-friendly data updating"
      text: >-
        The heart of the solution is our geoCMS Cartaro. Here, SBB can
        independently maintain all connections that are to be displayed on the
        map. Europe-wide train networks are available for this purpose, on which
        any connections can be freely entered. In addition to distinguishing
        between day and night connections, stops, brief descriptions and links
        can also be added. In keeping with the international nature of the map,
        the content can be entered in four languages (German, French, Italian
        and English). 


        A specially developed algorithm automatically generates the route network plan based on this data. Even during processing, SBB can preview the plan before creating the current vector tiles at the touch of a button.


        This allows editors to add new connections or edit existing ones with minimal effort. By maintaining the routes in Cartaro, they have maximum flexibility with their entries and at the same time benefit from the automated generation of the map at the touch of a button.

      title: "Looking ahead: even more service for rail passengers"
      text: >-
        International rail transport will continue to grow in importance,
        offering many opportunities for further development of the ‘Direct
        connections to Europe’ map. The map is integrated into the SBB website
        under direct connections and night connections to Europe and, like most
        of our maps for SBB, is also available on the Trafimage web map portal.


        Line network maps also provide a good overview for other applications. In addition to recording them in Cartaro, we also offer the option of automatically calculating route networks for maps with more lines based on timetable data.
