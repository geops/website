title: "Digital, interactive and up to date: the Swiss fare networks map"
summary: Switzerland has a large number of fare and transport associations with
  different areas of validity, some of which extend beyond cantonal borders. The
  fare networks map provides an overview of these, showing all associations in
  Switzerland at a glance and helping you to quickly identify which ticket is
  valid on which route.

      title: Automated, up-to-date, and consistent
      text: The fare network map was completely revamped at the beginning of 2021. In
        addition to a visual overhaul, the focus was primarily on technical
        modernization. The map, which had previously been maintained manually,
        was replaced by an automated process that standardized the web and print
        versions and significantly expanded the information content of the
        interactive web map.

      title: NOVA as a database
      text: The new map is based on the central fare database NOVA, which was
        developed as part of the “Future Swiss Public Transport Pricing System.”
        NOVA contains detailed information on the validity of season tickets and
        travel passes and has been used for years in applications such as the
        CASA sales application. This constantly updated data now also serves as
        the basis for the fare network map.

      title: Intelligent map creation
      text: The extent of the networks is shown at the municipal level – a deliberate
        generalization for the sake of clarity. A specially developed algorithm
        processes the NOVA data, calculates geographically accurate routes,
        takes into account defined exceptions within municipalities, and
        visually highlights overlaps between networks. The finished data is
        prepared as modern vector tiles for web display and enables
        high-performance, interactive use.

      title: Web and print from a single source
      text: The web map provides detailed information at the click of a button, such
        as the relevant networks and fare zones. At the same time, it forms the
        basis for high-quality print versions up to A0 format. PDFs with legends
        can be generated directly from the web map – web and print are no longer
        a contradiction, but part of the same solution.

      text: The new fare network map is state-of-the-art, reduces manual effort, and
        increases data quality and timeliness. Using the same database and a
        comparable workflow, we also create overviews of the validity of
        comprehensive products such as GA or Halbtax. This solution will
        continue to provide guidance in Switzerland's complex public transport
        fare system in the future.
