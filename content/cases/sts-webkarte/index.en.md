      title: Map with panoramic routes and points of interest
      text: The Swiss Travel Pass map on
        [swisstravelpass.com](https://swisstravelpass.com/) is based on the
        tried-and-tested Trafimage system. It shows the Swiss rail, bus and boat
        network in a clear, cartographically consistent representation. Special
        attention is given to well-known panoramic routes such as the Glacier
        Express and Bernina Express, panoramic mountain excursions such as the
        Rigi or the Schilthorn, and the Grand Train Tour of Switzerland. For
        each route, it is clear at a glance whether it is included in the Swiss
        Travel Pass or whether a supplement is required. The map also includes
        points of interest such as sights, museums and viewpoints, making travel
        planning inspiring, eventful and interactive.

      title: Orientation at a glance
      text: The card is an indispensable tool for Swiss Travel Pass holders. It shows
        which connections and offers are included in the ticket at any time and
        also provides ideas for exciting excursions along the way. Instead of
        relying on printed maps or scattered information, travellers have all
        the relevant data clearly and reliably available on their mobile
        devices.

        solutions for international travellers. In future, the card could be

testimonials:
  - text: For our digital map solution, it was crucial to implement a technically
      sound, future-proof and low-maintenance solution. In geOps, we found the
      ideal partner for this. We were particularly impressed by the structured
      integration of the STS validity areas from the NOVA database. Thanks to
      the direct data transfer and the targeted adaptation of the data
      structure, we were able to significantly reduce our internal maintenance
      effort while ensuring sustainable data quality. We greatly appreciate the
      professional implementation, transparent project management and reliable,
      solution-oriented cooperation with geOps at all times.
