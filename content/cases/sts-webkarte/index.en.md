      title: Map showing Grand Train Tour and direct connections from Europe
      text: The Swiss Travel Pass map on
        [swisstravelpass.com](https://swisstravelpass.com/) is based on the
        tried-and-tested Trafimage system. It shows the Swiss rail, bus and boat
        network in a clear, cartographically consistent representation. Special
        attention is given to well-known panoramic routes such as the Glacier
        Express and Bernina Express, panoramic mountain excursions such as the
        Rigi or the Schilthorn, and the Grand Train Tour of Switzerland. For
        each route, it is clear at a glance whether it is included in the Swiss
        Travel Pass or whether a supplement is required. The map also includes
        points of interest such as sights, museums and viewpoints, making travel
        planning inspiring, eventful and interactive.

      title: Orientation at a glance
      text: The card is an indispensable tool for Swiss Travel Pass holders. It shows
        which connections and offers are included in the ticket at any time.
        Instead of relying on printed maps or scattered information, travellers
        have all the relevant data clearly and reliably available on their
        mobile devices.

      title: "Looking ahead: rethinking digital travel companionship"
      text: Attractive and clear map material is an important tool in tourism
        marketing. Our map bases meet this requirement perfectly. Combined with
        important information that can be accessed via the map, they are not
        only an information medium for travellers but also enhance the positive
        experience and memories of a trip. Our credo is therefore that
        interactive maps cannot be overrated in tourism.

testimonials:
  - text: For our digital map solution, it was crucial to implement a technically
      sound, future-proof and low-maintenance solution. In geOps, we found the
      ideal partner for this. We were particularly impressed by the structured
      integration of the STS validity areas from the NOVA database. Thanks to
      the direct data transfer and the targeted adaptation of the data
      structure, we were able to significantly reduce our internal maintenance
      effort while ensuring sustainable data quality. We greatly appreciate the
      professional implementation, transparent project management and reliable,
      solution-oriented cooperation with geOps at all times.
