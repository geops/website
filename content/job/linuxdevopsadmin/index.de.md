## What awaits you

You will work in interdisciplinary teams on the development and operation of customer solutions and our own products. For the databases, interfaces, microservices and business applications that are required, you will organize the deploys and monitor operations with comprehensive monitoring. Our systems are top-notch, and yet there is always a lot to improve. You play a decisive role in the conception and implementation of all optimizations. You will also regularly have the opportunity to try out new technologies and evaluate them together with us.

You have excellent problem solving and communication skills. You feel comfortable in an agile, collaborative environment. You are interested in problem solving and solutions for public transport, forward-looking forms of mobility and the environment.

Ideally, but not necessarily, you have a university degree in computer science or other natural and engineering sciences or an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
