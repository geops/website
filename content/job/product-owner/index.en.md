* You have an overview of the "market" and have a well-maintained professional network.
* You are familiar and interested in basic business financial aspects.
* You are open, creative and committed and have the ability to get things done.
* Thanks to high communication skills, you will convince those around you of your ideas.
* You have high demands on yourself and on the solutions for which you are responsible.
* Ideally, you have a university degree in computer science or other natural and engineering courses.

* Smart working with options for home office, mobile working and, by arrangement, the option of part-time.
* Good earning potential and attractive additional benefits on top of the fixed salary (e.g. job ticket / GA, vouchers, fitness program and much more).
* Always enough organic fruit, mineral water and organic coffee and - after Covid - regular team events.
